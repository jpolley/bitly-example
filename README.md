# Bitlinks API tests using Playwright

## Dev Setup

1\. Clone this repo & `cd` into root directory

2\. Create `.env` file in root directory

```bash
echo "API_URL=https://api-ssl.bitly.com\nACCESS_TOKEN=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx" > .env
```

3\. Paste your valid API [ACCESS_TOKEN](https://app.bitly.com/settings/api) in `.env` file and save üíæ


4\. Ensure [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) is installed, and the correct version of nodejs used

```bash
nvm install # check .nvmrc to see the required version of node
nvm use
```

5\. Get the correct nodejs things

```bash
rm -r node_modules
nvm use
npm install
```

6\. Run the tests

```bash
npx playwright test
```

7\. Run the tests in ‚ú®UI Mode‚ú® for a better experience. You can walk through each step of the test and see each request that was made. It's pretty neat for reviewing the API request, response, & body. 

```bash
npx playwright test --ui
```

Just click the ‚ñ∂Ô∏è play button to kick off the tests:

```bash
docker compose up
```
